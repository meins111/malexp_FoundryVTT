      "player": "Ostensibly designed for mining operations, blasting charges are most often bulky tubes filled with compact explosives. Though they are designed to be linked together and detonated from a distance, they are nonetheless favoured as improvised explosives by gangs and dissidents on industrial worlds, where knowledge of their operation is widespread and are found in bulk. Blasting charges are powerful but have a limited radius.",
