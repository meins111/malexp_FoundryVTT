      "player": "The “torch” or “gas-lighter”, as most call it, is not strictly a weapon but an industrial tool that uses incandescent vapour to burn debris and clear the fungal growths that plague many hive duct-systems. The “gas-lighter” also serves well enough as a flamer for many low-rent hive gangs who can’t afford the real thing and is frequently found in the hands of insurrectionists. The “torch” is nowhere near as effective (or stable) as a true flamer, but it is easy to procure and the wash of burning gas can still crisp flesh to cinders.",
