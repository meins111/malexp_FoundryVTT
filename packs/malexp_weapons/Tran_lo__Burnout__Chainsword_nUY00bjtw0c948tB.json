      "player": "Chain weapons have the Rend and Loud Traits while they are activated. Additionally, while active, chain weapons impose Disadvantage on Stealth Tests. \nWhen a character wielding the Burnout Chainsword deals damage, they can choose to pull its secondary activation trigger to deal an extra +3 Damage with the attack. This uses up the Chainsword remaining battery power, sometimes damaging the chain mechanism; the weapon gains the Ineffective Trait until it is repaired. The mechanism for activating this feature is often unwieldy. Fumbling with this weapon in any capacity on a roll of 88, 99, or 00 causes it to activate by accident.",
