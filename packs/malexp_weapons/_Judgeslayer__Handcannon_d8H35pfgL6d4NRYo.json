The more desperate among these scum take precautions against such a discovery, seeking out Hereteks or backstreet killsmiths and demanding weapons capable of stopping a carapace-armored Arbitrator in their tracks. Thousands of different confiscated “Judgeslayer” designs of this broad type line the walls of the vaults of precinct fortresses across the galaxy, a silent litany of murder and infamy stretching back centuries. All such designs are characterized by a crazed disregard for the safety of the user, as all normal precautions in pistol design are thrown to the winds to allow the creation of a weapon as likely as lethal to its user as its victim.",
