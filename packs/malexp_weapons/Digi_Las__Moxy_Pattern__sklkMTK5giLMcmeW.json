      "player": "Impossibly advanced, the digi-weapons of the enigmatic Jokaero slip easily onto a user’s fingers like rings and fire either with a simple press of a button or by squeezing the band. The weapons themselves vary immensely and never seem to completely run out of ammunition, a facet of their design that remains a mystery to the Adeptus Mechanicus. The Weapons Table on the next page lists the most common digi-weapon, which incorporates the profile of a laspistol. Other digi-weapon types can include ones incorporating the profile of a flamer, grav pistol, inferno pistol, needle pistol, plasma pistol, or others at the GM’s discretion, by applying the Digitized weapon trait. It is easier to acquire a Digi-Weapon rather than digitizing a weapon, and no Endeavors are required to acquire one unless ordered at the GM’s discretion, unlike the Digital Weapon Weapon Upgrade.",
