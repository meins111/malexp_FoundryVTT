      "player": "Carried by the most slab-muscled of gang heavies and other degenerate scum, Impalers (also known as the “harpoon cannon”), as primitive as they are, can still launch a spear of metal capable of punching straight through a human body with ease. Usually made by desperate and ill-equipped hive or mutant gangs from discarded industrial springs and high- tensile cable, the harpoons used are often little more than a length of metal piping with its tip ground to a wicked point. Up-hive gunslingers and enforcers may scoff at the crudity of these weapons but sometimes find that it is much harder to laugh when pinned to a wall by a meter-long spear.",
